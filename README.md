# Augmenting OCR to Reverse Engineer Historical Matching Algorithms

**Yale University Tobin Research**

## Project Description

This project focuses on applying computer vision and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques to analyze printed data outputs generated by a college allocation program (University of Chile, 1982). The data, structured according to the Deferred Acceptance algorithm, provides a unique opportunity to innovate within the fields of computer vision and mechanism design.

We will leverages traditional OCR methods, augmented by an understanding of the underlying algorithm and data structure, to accurately read and interpret the printed output. The ultimate goal is to replicate the data-generating code and improve data collection efficiency. This project will explore the intersection of computer vision and economic theory, offering a novel approach to reverse engineering historical matching algorithms.
